***Part of a series of Shiny Apps to support education of risk managers
and trading analysts in Universities and commodity-trading
enterprises.***

# RTLappDynamics

It is designed and shared publicly to support the following:

-   Support a live walk-though of the dynamics of commodity markets by
    an experienced market professional. Whether this a non-technical
    audience or at the start of technical training risk managers or
    trading analysts, these concepts are critical to anyone with either
    interest or current governance accountability in these markets.

-   Part of class material in learning `shiny` app deployment where we
    start with the simple app and transform it into a `package` using
    [golem](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/golem).
